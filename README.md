### Contribution

You can modify and/or add braille language files (braille6.js, braille8new.js, braille8old.js).

Those are javascript files, not JSON, to be able to include them in the index.html file when working offline without a server.

Any new language file respecting this format will be automaticaly taken into account. The name of the language must contain '6 dots' if it is based on 6 dots, '8 dots' if based on 8 dots.
